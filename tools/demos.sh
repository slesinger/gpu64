# demos.sh - assemble the gpu64 demonstration programs and check them on a PC.
#
# For each Source/Demos/gpu64_demo_*.a:
#   1. assemble it with 64tass into the matching .prg
#   2. run it under tools/prgsim, twice: once modelling a display with a
#      frame clock and once modelling one without, because a demo that only
#      works on the first is broken on hardware nobody can predict. The
#      first run is 400 frames -- see the comment on --stop-after below
#   3. render what the HDMI output was showing when it finished, into
#      Source/Demos/out/<name>.ppm
#
# A class-1 demo is handled differently at step 3. The model does not
# rasterise class 1 -- see tools/prgsim/gpu64class1.py -- so there is no page
# for --ppm to photograph. Instead the run writes a frame stream, and
# tools/hostsim/scenesim renders EVERY frame of it through the firmware's own
# gpu64_3dSceneRender(). out/<name>.ppm is the last of those, and
# out/<name>.c1/ holds the stream, its blobs and the per-frame PPMs.
#
# The demos are not the conformance suite: they assert nothing and reach no
# verdict. What this script establishes is that each one assembles, runs to
# completion in both display cases, and produces a picture -- which is the
# part that would otherwise cost bench time to find out. Look at the PPMs
# before deploying; that is the whole point of rendering them.
#
# Note that 64tass is invoked WITHOUT --nostart: that option strips the
# 2-byte load address and produces a PRG that loads to the wrong place and
# silently never runs.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/demos.sh                # assemble + run + render everything
#   tools/demos.sh hello rotate   # just these
#   tools/demos.sh -v hello       # and print the C64 screen it produced
#   tools/demos.sh --chain        # also check every class-0 demo renders the
#                                 # same when launched on top of another
#                                 # demo's leftover gpu64 state
