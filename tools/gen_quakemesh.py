"""
Builds the class-1 mesh blobs for gpu64_demo_quake3d from the same room
gpu64_demo_quake.a draws with class 2.

The two layers do not share a coordinate system. Class 2 is a map renderer:
x east, y north, z up. Class 1 is left-handed with x right, y UP and z away
from the camera. So a class-2 point (x,y,z) is the class-1 point (x, z, y) --
a swap of two axes. Class 1 draws a face when it is clockwise on screen, so
what matters is not the swap's handedness in the abstract but where the
camera stands: FACES below is wound to be clockwise as seen from INSIDE the
room, which is why the room is solid from the inside and see-through from
the outside. The vertex order is passed through unchanged.

Texcoords are per-corner bytes here, not the class-2 texinfo axes, so the
axes are evaluated at the corners instead: eight texels to the world unit,
the same density texinfoTab uses. A byte wraps, so a face whose raw
coordinate goes negative is biased by a multiple of the 32-texel texture --
which shifts it by a whole number of tiles and so cannot change how it lines
up with its neighbours.
