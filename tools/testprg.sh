# testprg.sh - assemble the gpu64 API conformance suite and desk-check it.
#
# For each Source/TestPRG/gpu64_test_*.a:
#   1. assemble it with 64tass into the matching .prg
#   2. run it under tools/prgsim against a reference model of the API built
#      from docs/api_design.md, and require VERDICT PASS
#
# Step 2 is the point. A test that encodes a misreading of the reference
# fails here, on a PC, in a second -- rather than at the bench, where the
# same red line would be indistinguishable from a firmware defect and where
# the time to investigate it is expensive. Green here means "the suite
# asserts what the document says"; red at the bench then means "the
# firmware does not".
#
# Note that 64tass is invoked WITHOUT --nostart: that option strips the
# 2-byte load address and produces a PRG that loads to the wrong place and
# silently never runs. See project/progress_tracker.md.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/testprg.sh              # assemble + desk-check everything
#   tools/testprg.sh system draw  # just these
#   tools/testprg.sh -v system    # and print the screen it produced
