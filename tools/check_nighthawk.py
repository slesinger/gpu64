"""check_nighthawk.py - the autopilot checkride: one circuit, one landing.

tools/demos.sh runs gpu64_demo_nighthawk for 1500 frames and leaves the
verdict to whoever looks at the picture. That proves the scene draws, but
the claim the demo actually makes is that a C64 flies the aeroplane: the
flight model, the terrain height under the wheels, the touchdown rules and
the autopilot that strings them together. A picture of a jet over a field
looks the same whether or not any of that works.

So this flies the whole circuit with the autopilot (F3) -- the takeoff,
four waypoints over the land and the sea, a 3-degree final from the south
and the rollout -- and then reads the cockpit screen:

  LAND 001 CRASH 000   one landing, and nothing broke a touchdown rule
                       (CRASH 000/n names the rule if one did: see flTouch)
  FIRSTBAD 000         set-up never saw an ERRCODE
  FRAMES == OK         every frame committed

The circuit takes about 4800 frames. The run stops at 5300: past the
landing, and before the autopilot's second lap could land again.

Then the strike (key 2 selects mission 2): the same autopilot flies to the
radar site, opens the bay, drops the GBU and comes home. Row 13 must read
"M2 HIT" -- the bomb's own ballistics hit the site, nothing was scripted --
and the landing rules above apply again. It lands at about frame 4500 and
stops at 5000.

Then the two night missions. Key 3, the bridge: "M3 HIT", landed by about
6240, stopped at 6300. Key 4, the factory, where two MiGs fly a combat air
patrol over the target: the autopilot has to shoot at least one down with
its AIM-9s ("K 1" or more on row 13) and survive their IR missiles with
flares, which it can only do if the missiles, the flares and the MiGs all
work; "M4 HIT" and the landing as before. It is the long one, most of ten
minutes, so all four rides run at once.
