"""check_game.py - did a door actually MOVE?

tools/demos.sh normally asserts nothing: it establishes that a demo
assembles, runs and produces a picture, and leaves the verdict to whoever
looks at the PPM. gpu64_demo_game is the one demo where that is not enough.
Its whole claim is that a C64 can run the game logic -- read the level's
entities, match a button to its door, animate the door, and keep the
collision hull in step with what is drawn -- and every part of that claim is
invisible in a picture of a corridor. A door frozen shut and a door that
opens look identical in any single frame a reader happens to photograph.

So this checks the one thing the pictures cannot: that at a frame where the
player is standing in a doorway, the scene node the door is drawn with has
MOVED away from the entity's origin, along the entity's own travel vector
and no further than it. That is the whole animation path end to end -- the
scan, the touch test, the state machine, the fixed-point multiply and
SET_POSITION -- reduced to one number a script can compare.

It is deliberately not a check that the door reached any particular
fraction: DOOR_STEP is a gameplay constant and this must not break when
somebody makes the doors slower.

Usage (see the game) case in tools/demos.sh):
  tools/check_game.py --prg=... --level=... --frame=110 --ent=310 --key=W:20-51 ...
  tools/check_game.py ... --frame=400 --ent=29 --shut   # and it closed again
