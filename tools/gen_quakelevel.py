"""
Converts a Quake BSP out of PAK0.PAK into a gpu64 class-1 level file.

Why this exists: step 4 of the v1 plan is to build a real game on the
retained scene and so prove the frozen API is enough to build one with. A
hand-authored room does not prove that; E1M1 does.

The two formats meet each other more than half way. Quake textures are 8bpp
indexed with power-of-two dimensions, which is exactly what UPLOAD_TEXTURE
takes; Quake's palette is 256 RGB triples, which is what SET_PALETTE takes;
and gpu64's per-corner UV bytes are texel coordinates that wrap, which is
what BSP texinfo produces. The work is therefore not format translation, it
is fitting the level into three hard limits:

  * 256 vertices per mesh          -- the 1-byte face index
  * +-128 world units per mesh     -- vertices are signed 8.8 model space
  * 255 texels of UV span per face -- UV bytes wrap at 256

so the level is cut into chunks, each chunk a mesh, each mesh placed by a
node transform. Chunking is spatial, which is also what makes per-object
culling worth anything later.

# the same two-axis swap gen_quakemesh.py documents.

# Winding survives that swap unchanged, and this is worth stating because the
# obvious argument gets it backwards. Quake stores a face's vertex ring
# counter-clockwise seen from the front; gpu64 wants clockwise seen from
# outside (gpu64_3d_render.cpp's own header comment). Swapping two axes
# mirrors the world, which turns counter-clockwise into clockwise -- so the
# swap IS the conversion, and reversing the ring on top of it undoes the
# work. It was written the wrong way round first, and tools/hostsim/levelsim
# caught it exactly as that comment predicts: from inside a room the level
# was see-through, three of eight directions rendering nothing at all,
# instead of enclosed. --flip-winding is kept for that A/B.

# Entities.
#
# The entity lump is where the *game* lives -- spawns, monsters, items, and
# the targetname/target wiring that makes a button open a door. It is carried
# through into the level file rather than left behind in the BSP, because the
# C64 side has no BSP parser and 369 text blocks will not fit in its RAM
# anyway. Strings are deduped into one blob and referenced by offset; offset 0
# is a lone NUL so 0 reads as "no string".
#
# Two numeric slots (p0, p1) are deliberately generic. Which key lands in them
# depends on the classname -- speed/wait for a door, light/style for a light,
# health for a monster -- and hard-coding a union per class here would freeze a
# game design that does not exist yet. ENT_PARAMS says what each class puts
# there, and the game reads it the same way.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A classname is a string, and a 6502 game that had to strcmp its way through
# 420 of them every level would spend the level loading. So each record also
# carries a `kind` byte, assigned here, and the game switches on that. The
# ranges are grouped so a game can ask a coarse question ("is this a monster?")
# with a comparison instead of a table: 1-9 world and wiring, 10-19 movers,
# 20-29 triggers, 30-49 pickups, 50-79 monsters, 80-89 scenery, 90-99 lights
# and sound. 0 is "a classname this converter has no opinion about", which a
# game is free to treat as decoration -- it is never an error.
#
# The generic value at the bottom of each range is what an unlisted member of
# a family gets (a monster this table has never heard of is still a monster),
# which is what keeps a map from another episode from arriving as 420 zeroes.
