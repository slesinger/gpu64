Run a gpu64 conformance-suite .prg against the reference model and print
the C64 screen it produced.

    tools/prgsim/runsim.py Source/TestPRG/gpu64_test_system.prg

Exit status is 0 only if the program reached its summary line and that line
says VERDICT PASS, so this drops straight into a build script.

What this is for: the suite asserts what docs/README.md and the files it
indexes specify. Run
here, a failure means the TEST is wrong -- the model is built from the same
document. Run on hardware, a failure means the FIRMWARE is wrong. Getting
the first kind out of the way on a PC is the whole point, because bench time
is the scarce resource and a red line at the bench should mean something.

Options:
    --no-vblank     model a display whose frame clock never calibrated, so
                    every vblank feature answers UNSUPPORTED. The suite is
                    expected to pass in this mode too -- it adapts.
    --dump-scene        print the retained scene node table at the end
    --write-stats[=F]   count register-window traffic from rendered frame F
                        (default 50) to the end, and print writes/frame,
                        reads/frame and a per-opcode table to stderr --
                        which commands the bus budget is actually spent on
    --level2=FILE       RAD/level2.g64lev: LOAD_LEVEL slot 1 (ARG6=1, ARG7=$5B)
    --reu=FILE          a level pack (tools/pack_levels.py) as the REU image:
                        its levels become slots 0 and 1, replacing --level/2
    --level=FILE        stand in for RAD/level.g64lev on the Pi's SD card, so
                        LOAD_LEVEL/LEVEL_STEP build a real level. Without it
                        LOAD_LEVEL answers BAD_ARGS, as it does on a card that
                        has no level on it
    --clip-fault=N[:KIND]  damage the Nth CLIP_MOVE answer past its checksum:
                        x (default) its x high byte, solid an ALLSOLID answer
                        that stays put; void makes answer N and every one
                        after a floorless free fall
    --bus-fault-until=F stop injecting after RENDERED frame F -- not the
                       demo's own frame counter, which runs ahead of it
                       whenever commits are missed
    --bus-fault-from=F  start injecting at RENDERED frame F, so setup runs
                       clean and the run measures what the frame loop
                       repairs rather than whether setup survived
    --bus-fault=KIND:N
        Make every Nth access to the gpu64 register window ($DF50-$DFFF) go
        wrong, the two ways the hardware is known to be able to make one go
        wrong. KIND is:
          drop  the access never reaches the firmware at all. A read
                answers $FF off a floating bus and is not counted; a write
                simply does not happen and is not counted.
          addr  the access IS serviced, but at a mis-sampled address: bit
                6 comes back set, which is the shape of damage real
                hardware can do (A0-A3 are on dedicated GPIOs, A4-A7 on the
                multiplexed ones). A read answers $FF, a write
                is discarded, and both are counted -- including in the
                bad-address counters GET_HEALTH reports.
          both  alternate between the two, so a probe that has to tell
                them apart has to tell them apart in the same run.
          data  a WRITE is serviced at the right address but with one data
                bit flipped (the bit rotates 0..7 from fault to fault);
                reads are untouched. Bench run 38 proved this one exists:
                SCENE_COMMITs answered BAD_OPCODE, which only a corrupted
                CMD_LO byte can produce -- and a corrupted opcode that
                lands on a VALID one is a phantom command. This is the kind
                that tests a state refresh ring against phantoms rather
                than against lost ARG writes.
          phantom  a WRITE to any other gpu64 register is serviced as a
                write to CMD_LO instead, with its own data byte as the
                opcode: a command dispatches that the C64 never sent, on
                whatever ARG bytes happen to be staged, and the ARG write
                itself is lost. Bench video 2026-09-27: E1M1's field of
                view jumping to values the program cannot send -- a
                SET_PERSPECTIVE run on SET_POSITION's staged bytes.
        There is no defect here to find: this exists so that a probe's
        diagnosis of a defect can be checked against a known answer on a PC.
        Source/TestPRG/gpu64_probe_bus.a is the one that needs it, and its
        header says which verdict each kind must produce. The injector is
        indiscriminate -- it will happily eat a CMD_LO write and turn a
        command into nothing -- so keep N well above the number of accesses
        any single command costs.

    --alias-drop=OFF[,OFF...]
        Corrupt a C64-space blob write: each listed byte offset comes back as
        the byte at offset $FF of its own page. Models the hardware failure
        the blit suite is chasing, so its diagnostic lines can be validated
        against a known answer here rather than at the bench.

    --firmware-rounding
                    round 8.8 products the way the firmware currently does
                    rather than the way the reference specifies, to predict
                    which suite lines a given firmware will fail.
    --ppm=PATH      write what the HDMI output would be showing when the
                    program returned -- the visible page, through the
                    current palette, inside the border -- as a PPM. This is
                    how a demo gets verified on a PC instead of at the
                    bench.
    --key=NAME:FIRST-LAST
        Hold a key down from frame FIRST to frame LAST, counting page flips
        the way --stop-after does. Repeatable. Without it every key reads as
        released, which is what an unwired $dc01 does NOT do -- it reads 0,
        i.e. the whole keyboard held at once -- so a demo that steers by the
        keyboard needs this option for its desk run to mean anything.
        Names: W A S D Q E, F1 F3 F5 F7, SPACE, RETURN, RUNSTOP, and the
        letters and digits in the table below.
    --joy=DIR[+DIR...]:FIRST-LAST
        Hold joystick 2 from frame FIRST to frame LAST, counted as --key
        counts. DIR is UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT FIRE. Port 2 is $dc00, the same
        lines the keyboard scan drives its columns on, so a held direction
        also grounds that column exactly as on hardware: a key pressed in
        columns 0-4 then ghosts into every scan. Without it $dc00 reads back
        whatever was written to it, i.e. a joystick nobody touches.
    --mouse=DX,DY[,FIRE]:FIRST-LAST
        A 1351 mouse in port 1: from frame FIRST to LAST, move DX, DY pot
        counts a frame (Y positive is away from you) and, with FIRE, hold
        the left button, which grounds $dc01 bit 4 as on hardware. Without
        it $d419/$d41a read $ff, an empty port. Repeatable.
    --notarget      gpu64_demo_game.a: the monsters never notice the
                    player, as Quake's notarget cheat. Route checks that are
                    about doors, not fights, run with it.
    --telemetry-off gpu64_demo_game.a: leave its C64-screen telemetry off,
                    as on hardware until F5. Without it runsim turns the
                    rows on ($02aa), because the checks read them.
    --warp=F:X,Y,Z,YAW  gpu64_demo_game.a: at frame F restart the game with
                    the eye at X Y Z (world units) facing YAW (0..255), so
                    a check can start beside what it is about.
    --hop=F:X,Y,Z,YAW   the same, but nothing restarts: only the eye moves,
                    doors, counters and kills keep their state. Repeatable,
                    so one run can visit rooms that are far apart.
    --title         gpu64_demo_game.a: run the title (logo sweep, Quake
                    title, skill menu) instead of skipping it. Frames are
                    its page flips; the sweep flips none. Not with
                    --frame-ms, and give it a --stop-after large enough
                    for the menu's column-7 reads.
    --skill=N       the skill the skipped menu returns: 0 easy, 1 normal
                    (default), 2 hard, 3 nightmare.
    --hurt=F,F,...  gpu64_demo_game.a: 20 damage to the player at each frame
                    listed (the old <- test key; <- is the pause menu now).
    --sid-log=PATH  write every SID register write ($D400-$D418) to PATH,
                    one line each: frame, IRQ count, register, value.

    IRQs: once a program points $0314 anywhere but the KERNAL's $EA31, the
    sim raises an IRQ every (CIA1 timer A latch / 4) instructions while the
    I flag is clear, entering the handler the way the KERNAL's $FF48 does
    (A, X, Y pushed) and returning through $EA31/$EA81, which pull them and
    RTI. Nothing else of the KERNAL's IRQ runs. A program that never hooks
    $0314 sees no change.
    --frame-ms=N    lock the CIA2 millisecond clock to the frame count: it
                    reads N ms per frame and never moves within one, so a
                    program that scales its motion by the measured frame
                    time (gpu64_demo_game.a) moves the same on every run and
                    every build. The game's checks pass 32, the frame time
                    its constants were tuned at, i.e. a scale of exactly 1;
                    another N is how the scaling itself is checked. Without
                    it the clock is the default instruction-count estimate.
    --render-ms=N   core 1 takes N ms over each class-1 loop frame instead
                    of none, and FRAME_READY rises only where the firmware
                    raises it: in the flip's hold if the frame is done by
                    then, else at the next dispatch. A program that only
                    polls STATUS while a frame finishes late waits out its
                    whole timeout, as gpu64_demo_game.a did at the bench on
                    2026-09-28. Use it without --frame-ms, whose clock does
                    not move within a frame.
    --demo          do not require a VERDICT line. The conformance suite
                    judges itself and exit status follows its verdict; a
                    demo has nothing to judge, so returning cleanly is the
                    whole of the pass condition.
    --stop-after=N  report the STOP key pressed on the Nth poll rather than
                    the 4th. A demo polls STOP once a frame, so this is how
                    many frames it runs. THE DEFAULT OF 4 IS NOT A CHECK:
                    a defect whose onset is frame 98 is invisible to it, and
                    that has already happened once on this project. Any demo
                    change wants a run of several hundred.
    --frame-log     print one line per page flip: frame number, the drawn
                    page's non-zero pixel count, and the two status rows the
                    demo prints. This is what turns "it blinks" into a frame
                    number and a delta.
    --log-light=ID  append scene node ID's light strength/radius to every
                    --frame-log line, as [L<ID> s/r] (- while it is absent)
    --log-rows=A-B  the screen rows a --frame-log line quotes (default
                    20-24), for a demo whose interesting rows are elsewhere
    --ppm-frame=N:PATH
                    write the page being flipped away at frame N. Repeatable.
    --c1-stream=PATH
        Write the class-1 frame stream -- one record per accepted
        SCENE_COMMIT, plus the resource blobs beside it -- for
        tools/hostsim/scenesim to render with the firmware's own renderer.
        The model does not rasterise class 1 (see tools/prgsim/gpu64class1.py),
        so this, not --ppm, is how a class-1 demo gets a picture on a PC.
        For a class-1 demo a "frame" is an accepted SCENE_COMMIT, so
        --stop-after counts those.
    --chain=PRG     run PRG first, on the same model, before the program
        named on the command line. Repeatable, applied in order. This is how
        a state leak BETWEEN programs is reproduced on a PC: the RAD menu
        launches a .prg without resetting the C64, so gpu64 keeps whatever
        the previous program left behind -- its palette, its draw/visible
        page pairing, its framebuffer contents, its display mode. Each
        chained program gets its own --stop-after budget and its screen is
        discarded; only the last program's screen and PPM are reported.
        A demo that comes up right after a reset and wrong after another
        demo is exactly this, and $0B FULL_RESET is the cure.
    --trace N       dump the last N instructions if something goes wrong
    --max N         instruction budget (default 200 million)
