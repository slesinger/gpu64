# deploy_prg.sh - put this tree's .prg files on a mounted RAD SD card, and
# take off the ones this tree no longer builds.
#
# The card's RAD_PRG directory accumulates: it holds gpu64's own programs
# next to the user's C64 software, and it has collected renamed and
# abandoned copies of gpu64 programs across the campaign (gpu643d0.prg,
# gpu64api.prg, gpu64lad.prg -- 8-character names from before the tree
# settled on gpu64_<kind>_<name>). Picking the current build out of that
# list at the bench is a way to waste a round on a stale program, which has
# already happened once with a stale kernel image.
#
# So this copies every .prg from Source/TestPRG and Source/Demos, and then
# removes any *gpu64* .prg on the card that this tree does not build. It
# never touches anything that is not gpu64's: the games, the monitors, the
# memory tester and readme.txt are left exactly where they are.
#
# It does NOT build anything. Run tools/testprg.sh and tools/demos.sh first
# if you want the .prg files to be current -- they are what assembles them.
# The firmware image is tools/build.sh's job, not this one's.
#
# Usage:
#   SDCARD=/media/you/SIDEKICK tools/deploy_prg.sh          # copy + prune
#   SDCARD=/media/you/SIDEKICK tools/deploy_prg.sh --dry-run
