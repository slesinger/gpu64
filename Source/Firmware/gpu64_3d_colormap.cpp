/*
 gpu64 milestone 6 -- BUILD_COLORMAP, and the render state's defaults.

 The mechanism is Doom's: the palette stays 256 freely-chosen colours and
 lighting goes through a generated table, so textures can use every entry and
 no ramp layout is imposed on the artist. Rationale in
 project/milestone6_3d_design.md, "Lighting: a generated colormap".

 Portable: compiled unchanged by the firmware and by tools/hostsim.
