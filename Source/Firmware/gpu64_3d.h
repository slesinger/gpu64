// gpu64: the whole class 1 subsystem behind one toggle, the same way the
// ladder and the multicore spike are. Off = gpu64_apiDispatch() keeps
// answering class 1 with BAD_CLASS exactly as it does today, core 1 stays
// parked, and nothing below is linked in.
//
// ON by default on this branch, and that is a real change to the shipping
// configuration: it brings CMultiCoreSupport::Initialize() up in every
// build, which milestone 6a showed is safe on its own but which the
// milestone 4 releases did not do. Comment it out to get the proven
// single-core build back -- that is the bisect handle if anything in
// class 0 regresses.

// all carry the one-shot key in ARG15 and refuse with BAD_ARGS without it --
// GPU64_KEY_DESTRUCTIVE in gpu64_api.h, which has the whole reasoning. It
// started here, on 2026-09-10 morning, as an ARG[0] key on LOOP_STOP alone,
// out of bench run 11's $07-nobody-sent; run 14 the same afternoon found the
// same mechanism reaching something that destroyed the live scene's active
// camera, and ARG[0] turned out to be the wrong register anyway -- the
// per-frame node stream writes it constantly, so a phantom arriving
// mid-frame stands a real chance of finding a coordinate byte that happens
// to be $A5 already sitting there. ARG15 is read by no opcode and is spent
// by every dispatch.

// gpu64: not in the design doc's original table -- added in phase 1 because
// "you get OUT_OF_MEMORY eventually" is truthful and undebuggable against a
// 32 MB arena. RESULT is the free arena in 128 KB units, which is exactly

// reason to: it is level data, not game state. LOAD_LEVEL validates and arms;
// LEVEL_STEP performs one bounded slice of the build and reports progress, so
// the DMA hold per command stays in the same range as an ordinary REU
// transfer instead of halting the C64 for the whole load.
//
// Two new opcode numbers rather than arguments on UPLOAD_MESH, which is what
// the v1 surface freeze (project/milestone17*, gpu64-v1-surface-frozen)

// gpu64 (milestone 18): CLIP_MOVE, the answer to "can I walk here?".
//
// Collision is the one piece of game logic that cannot live on the C64 --
// E1M1's clipnodes are 43 KB and its planes another 36 KB -- and the Pi is
// already holding them. So the C64 sends where it is and where it would like
// to be, and gets back where it actually ends up. It stays authoritative:
// gpu64 never moves the camera, it only answers.
//
// Everything travels in one block in the C64's own memory rather than in the
// ARG registers, for two reasons. The first is that it does not fit: a
// position and a displacement in 16.16 are 24 bytes on their own. The second
// is the better one -- a block is one DMA burst where the registers would be
// twenty-four separate writes, i.e. twenty-four independent chances for the
// sampling defect to drop one, and a block can carry a checksum where the
// register file cannot.
//
// CLIP_MOVE is NOT keyed. It destroys no retained state; the state it could
// damage is the C64's own memory, and SET_DMA_WINDOW ($0C) is what confines
// that. A program that calls CLIP_MOVE should set the window.
//
// It is also the one class-1 opcode that answers while the render loop is
// running, because it reads nothing but the level file, which is immutable
// once loaded, and writes nothing but the caller's block.
#define GPU64_3D_OP_CLIP_MOVE		0x15

// The block, 56 bytes plus 16 per mover. ARG0-5 name it the way every other
// blob argument is named (space, 24-bit address, 16-bit length) and the length
// must cover all of it. Input is bytes 0..29 and the mover records from 56;
// the Pi writes 32..55 and never touches the input half, so a readback that
// fails its checksum can simply be retried.

// Then `movers` records of 16 bytes each, the first at byte 56. Each one is a
// brush model standing somewhere in the world: a closed door, a lowered

//
// The mover list is an argument, not retained state: gpu64 does not know which

// gpu64 (milestone 18): LEVEL_ENT, one entity out of the loaded level.
//
// A level's entity lump is where its game is: 369 records for E1M1, naming
// the player start, fourteen doors and their buttons, the triggers that open
// them, forty-two monsters and every item on the map. It is already in the
// Pi's memory because the level file carries it, and it cannot travel to the

// two obligations: check the output magic AND the output checksum, and set
// SET_DMA_WINDOW before calling. Unkeyed, and exempt from the pre-execute
// drain, again because the level file is immutable once loaded.
//
// The record is pre-digested for a 6502. Classnames arrive as a `kind` byte
// (a game switches on it; the ranges are in gpu64_level.h), target and
// targetname as opaque 16-bit ids that compare equal when the strings do, a
// brush mover's travel as a ready displacement, and a brush model's nodes as
// a contiguous run of scene node ids -- so moving a door is SET_POSITION on

//
// A level's palette is installed once, by LEVEL_STEP, and the C64 never holds

// could not repair from a shadow of its own. And it does get damaged: a
// corrupted CMD_HI turns a class 1 SET_POSITION ($30) into class 0 PAL_SET,
// which overwrites one palette entry with camera coordinates. Run 38's scene
// "lost its colours" a few minutes in, one entry at a time, and the injected
// runs in prgsim reproduce it.

// VideoCore and rebuilds the colormap (into the shadow state while the loop
// runs), because a phantom BUILD_COLORMAP could have baked the damage in.
