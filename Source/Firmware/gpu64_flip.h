/*
 gpu64: the page flip, without the mailbox round trip.

 The problem this solves: milestone 4b's deferred PAGE_FLIP commits from
 inside the bus-watch loop's DMA hold, and the only thing it does there is
 CBcmFrameBuffer::SetVirtualOffset() -- a *synchronous* property-mailbox
 call to the VideoCore. Measured on hardware over 256 flips: 71 us at best,
 ~900 us typically. The C64 is halted for all of it, so a program flipping
 every frame hands roughly 5% of its cycles to the commit, and a hold that
 long can span a raster and flash the VIC-II.

 Almost none of that cost is the ARM's. Writing the request into MAILBOX1 is
 a status poll and one 32-bit store; the rest is waiting for the VideoCore's
 mailbox task to be *scheduled*, which is also why the figure is so erratic.
 So this module splits the round trip in half:

   gpu64_flipPost()   -- inside the DMA hold: store the offset, write the
                         mailbox, return. Sub-microsecond, and it does not
                         care when the VideoCore gets around to it.
   gpu64_flipDrain()  -- at the top of the next command dispatch: consume
                         the reply. NOTE, corrected 2026-09-06: this was
                         written as "outside the hold" and it is not.
                         gpu64_apiDispatch() is called from reuUsingPolling()
                         with CLR_GPIO(bDMA_OUT) already asserted, so every
                         microsecond the drain spins is a microsecond the
                         C64 is halted -- see the timeout note below.

 The drain is not just bookkeeping, it is what keeps the split safe. Once
 posted, the flip is in flight and the page the C64 may now draw into is not
 provably off-screen yet. But the C64 cannot draw anything without issuing a
 command, and every command drains first -- so by the time any drawing can
 happen, the VideoCore has processed the flip. The race is closed by
 construction rather than by timing luck.

 Draining also matters for a duller reason: Circle's CBcmMailBox::WriteRead()
 begins with a Flush() that discards stale replies with a *20 ms* delay
 each. An unconsumed reply of ours sitting in MAILBOX0 when Circle next uses
 the mailbox (PAL_SET, VBLANK_SYNC) would cost exactly that. Hence a drain
 before every such path, not only before the next post.

 Everything here is a deliberate duplicate of what CBcmPropertyTags does,
 for the one tag that needs to be cheap. It is not a general mailbox client
 and should not grow into one.
