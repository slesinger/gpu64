/*
 gpu64: the frame clock -- gpu64's vblank event source.

 The problem this solves: nothing in reuUsingPolling()'s bus-watch loop
 knows where the display raster is, so every vblank-related part of the API
 (docs/api_design.md) shipped as UNSUPPORTED in milestone 4. Circle does
 expose CBcmFrameBuffer::WaitForVerticalSync(), but it is a *blocking*
 mailbox round-trip to the VideoCore: calling it from the loop would stall
 the loop for up to a whole frame, which is exactly what the
 cycle-predictability rule forbids.

 So the loop never asks the VideoCore anything. Instead the frame period is
 measured once, at boot, by timing a run of WaitForVerticalSync() calls
 against the free-running 1MHz ARM system timer -- and from then on the loop
 finds the next frame boundary with a single MMIO read and a compare
 (gpu64_vsyncDue() below), which costs no more than the two
 read32(ARM_GPIO_GPLEV0) samples the loop already does every pass.

 This works because both clocks derive from the same 19.2MHz crystal on a
 Pi 3, so the ratio between them is fixed and the extrapolation does not
 wander the way two independent oscillators would. It is not exact, though:
 the measurement carries the mailbox's own latency as a constant offset, and
 residual period error accumulates over minutes. Hence gpu64_vsyncReanchor()
 -- one blocking vsync wait, so up to one frame of C64 halt -- exposed to the
 C64 as VBLANK_SYNC ($09) and done implicitly by VBLANK_ARM. Both are
 setup-time commands, not per-frame ones.
