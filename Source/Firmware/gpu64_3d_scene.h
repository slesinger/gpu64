/*
 gpu64 milestone 6, stage 14 -- the retained scene graph: nodes, transforms,
 and the active camera.

 Portable, like gpu64_3d_render.h and for the same reason: every transform bug
 -- ROTATE_LOCAL composing the wrong way, MOVE_LOCAL walking sideways instead
 of forward, a camera whose view is not actually the inverse of its pose -- is
 findable by tools/hostsim on a PC. What is deliberately NOT here is anything
 that resolves a mesh resource ID to a Gpu64_3dMesh: that table lives in
 gpu64_3d_class1.cpp because only core 0 can pull an upload off the C64 bus.
 DRAW_NODE therefore stays in gpu64_3d_class1.cpp too -- it is a resource
 lookup plus a call to the already-portable gpu64_3dDrawMesh(), not new
 rendering logic, exactly the way opDrawMesh() is a thin IO2 wrapper today.

 Wire formats and opcode semantics: project/milestone6_3d_design.md,
 "Transforms: no matrices cross the bus", and docs/class1-3d-mesh-reference.md's
 Scene nodes / Transforms tables. Not restated here.

// pState->lights[] directly.

// MUST be called after gpu64_3dSceneApplyCamera(): it reads the view
// transform that call produces. Call it the other way round and the lights
// are placed by the *previous* frame's camera, which looks like lights that
// lag the player by one frame -- visible only while moving.
//
// At most GPU64_3D_MAX_LIGHTS are taken, in scene order. A light is skipped
// when it is hidden (SET_VISIBLE 0) or inert (strength or radius zero), so
// a node created and not yet given parameters cannot occupy one of the eight

// every visible OBJECT node followed by every visible SPRITE node, in scene
// order. This is the body of the autonomous loop's frame, and it lives here
// -- portable, with no resource table of its own -- so that tools/hostsim
// renders a class-1 frame through *this* code rather than through a
// re-implementation of it. Stage 17: a demo verified on the host is only
// evidence about the bench if the node loop is literally the same one.
//
// The two lookups are how this reaches tables it must not own: meshes and
// textures both live in gpu64_3d_class1.cpp on the firmware and in the host
// harness on a PC. A node whose mesh does not resolve is skipped, not a
// failure -- one stale id must not blank an otherwise-good frame.
//
// Does NOT touch the framebuffer's page bookkeeping or any cache
// maintenance: the caller owns the target and what has to be flushed after.
