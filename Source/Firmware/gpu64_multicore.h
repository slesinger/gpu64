// gpu64: multicore feasibility spike for milestone 6 (see
// docs/milestone6_3d_design.md's "Architecture: a second core for the
// render loop" section) -- NOT the real render loop.
//
// Core 0 keeps running the existing, untouched, cycle-accurate
// reuUsingPolling() bus watch (started separately from CRAD::Run(), the
// same way it always has been -- this class does not touch core 0 at all).
//
// Cores 1-3 each continuously stream writes through a multi-megabyte
// buffer -- a render-loop-shaped memory access pattern, deliberately large
// enough to blow past the Cortex-A53's shared L2 (a plain register-resident
// counter, tried first, proves nothing about cache contention and was
// replaced after design review flagged it as testing the wrong thing: the
// real risk here is L2 *capacity* contention evicting core 0's hand-tuned
// preload schedule, not core-liveness or cache-coherency correctness).
//
// The pass/fail signal for this spike is NOT anything logged by this class
// -- it's whether milestone 3's existing hardware checks (mirror
// legibility, the $DF0B trigger flip, REU transfers staying byte-exact)
// still hold while this stress workload runs concurrently on another core.
// See progress_tracker.md for the test procedure and results.
