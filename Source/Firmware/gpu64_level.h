//
// The .g64lev level container: a whole 3D level (geometry, textures,
// entities and collision hulls) in one file the Pi holds in the REU image,
// so that putting a level on the HDMI screen costs the C64 two commands
// instead of 620 KB of REU uploads it does not have room for.
//
// Written by tools/gen_quakelevel.py and validated by tools/check_g64lev.py;
// the same bytes are rendered on a PC by tools/hostsim/levelsim.cpp before
// any of it goes near the bench. Format version 8 -- version 1 had no
// entities, 2 no collision, 3 no entity kind, 4 no hull 0, 5 no visibility,
// 6 no pictures, 7 no start position or body lengths (it took them from
// constants compiled into the firmware).
//
// This header is deliberately free of every gpu64 subsystem: it parses and
// range-checks, and says nothing about resources, scenes or the arena. The
// part that turns a parsed level into gpu64 resources lives in
// gpu64_3d_class1.cpp, which is where the resource table and the arena are.
