/*
 gpu64 milestone 6 -- the store-burst budget and the yield that enforces it.

 Split out of gpu64_3d_internals.h so the portable renderer (which knows
 nothing about the ring buffer, core 1, or Circle) can obey the same budget
 and still compile natively for tools/hostsim.

 Milestone 6a's result, in one constant. A core other than core 0 may write
 at most 7 consecutive cache lines (448 bytes) before yielding, or core 0's
 PHI-locked polling loop misses its deadline and the C64 derails. Rate is not
 an axis and neither is working-set size; only the length of an unbroken run
 of stores is. Full measurements: project/milestone6_3d_design.md, "The real
 risk: store bursts".

// 256 is the design figure rather than 448: it is 57% of the measured edge,
// it was clean at every rate tested, and it maps onto a natural unit -- a
// 320-pixel 8bpp scanline is 320 bytes, so one yield per scanline (or two)
// falls out of the geometry instead of being bolted on.
//
// 2026-09-27: the budget is now a runtime value, not a constant. 448 was
// measured on one C64; other boards (breadbin, Ultimate, C128) hang sooner or
// later, and the A/B runs put every bus fault on core 1's rendering. A
// smaller burst is the knob that trades render speed for bus margin, so it
// has to be settable per machine: rad.cfg's GPU64_BURST_BYTES, clamped to
// [MIN, MAX] by gpu64_3dSetSpanBytes(). Core 0 writes it once at boot, before
// core 1 starts; core 1 only reads it, so the multicore read rule is not
// involved.

// so the cheapest sufficient barrier is NOT yet a measured quantity. DSB is
// the conservative choice: it retires the outstanding stores before the next
// span starts, which is the property the budget assumes.
//
// OPEN ITEM: bench a DMB, and a plain nothing-at-all, against a real REU
// round-trip. If a weaker barrier holds, the rasteriser's inner loop gets
// measurably cheaper. Do not weaken this on reasoning alone -- three
// published diagnoses in milestone 6a were killed by later rounds.
