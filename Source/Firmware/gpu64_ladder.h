// gpu64: what this is, and why it is not the 2026-08-22 stress spike.
//
// The spike (gpu64_multicore.h) answered one binary question with a
// deliberately worst-case workload: three cores streaming 2MB buffers flat
// out corrupt the C64's own VIC-II output, while multicore *bring-up* alone
// does not. That leaves milestone 6's actual question open -- the render
// loop does not need flat-out bandwidth, it needs *some*, and nobody knows
// how much is safe. See docs/milestone6_3d_design.md: "find the actual
// contention threshold (a load ladder ... working up rather than starting
// from a deliberately worst-case synthetic stress)".
//
// So: one worker core (not three -- the design says start with core 0 plus
// one worker and expand only once that is measured), stepping through a
// ladder of *throttled* bandwidths, while core 0 measures its own bus-watch
// loop and the C64 runs a real REU + gpu64 workload. Each rung lasts a
// fixed wall-clock window; the whole ladder is one hardware run, and the
// result is a table printed by LOG_ENABLE(1).
//
// The pass/fail number is per-rung `L=`: bus cycles core 0 missed. The
// previous rounds' pass/fail signal was "does the RAD menu look like
// garbage", which cannot rank rungs. This one can.
//
// LEFT ON deliberately, unlike gpu64_multicore.h's toggles: this exists for
// one bench round and the image that round needs is the one tools/build.sh
// produces by default. **Comment it back out once the ladder result is
// recorded in docs/progress_tracker.md.** It forces multicore bring-up on
// (rad_main.h) whatever gpu64_multicore.h's own toggles say, it widens
// reuUsingPolling()'s instruction-cache preload window (below), and it puts
// measurement code inside that loop -- a diagnostic build, never a shipping
// one.
//
// With it commented out, every byte of this file compiles away: verified by
// building both ways and diffing the symbol table -- reuUsingPolling() comes
// out at the same address and the same 0x1b54 bytes as before the ladder
// existed.
// gpu64: milestone 6a is finished (2026-08-23, round 18) -- OFF for shipping.
// Uncomment only to re-run the ladder on the bench; it forces multicore
// bring-up on, widens the i-cache preload window to 0x2000, and puts
// measurement code inside reuUsingPolling().
//#define GPU64_LADDER_ENABLED

// Widen the polling loop's rolling i-cache preload window *without* dragging
// in the rest of the ladder. This exists to test one hypothesis and nothing
// else: the shipping window is 0x1a00 measured from reuEmulationMainLoop,
// and the loop runs past it (see the docs), so a tail of real bus-handling
// code -- the PMCCNTR waits, the GPIO reads, INP_GPIO_RW -- never enters the
// rolling preload. That is a candidate mechanism for the rare dropped IO2
// write the phase-0 bench found: an i-cache miss in the tail makes the loop
// too busy to sample a C64 write, which is lost outright.
//
// The ladder builds already ran at 0x2000 without trouble, so the widened
// window is known not to break anything by itself. Cost is a staler preload
// -- 128 passes to walk the window instead of 104 -- and about 1.3KB of
// overshoot past the end of the function, which merely preloads neighbouring
// code and is harmless.
//
// 2026-08-24: tested and OFF. The two-hour run at 0x2000 saw 14 events in
// 360000 frames -- 1 per 25700, against 1 per 23250 from the narrow-window
// runs. No effect whatsoever, so the tail falling outside the preload is not
// the mechanism and the shipping window stays at 0x1a00. The toggle is kept
// because it is a clean one-line way to take this variable off the table
// again after any change to the loop's size.
//#define GPU64_POLL_IPL_WIDE

// The isolation control the first bench round turned out to need. With this
// commented out, the ladder build keeps *everything* that touches core 0 --
// the per-pass measurement, the widened preload window, multicore bring-up
// -- but core 1 never runs the worker at all and parks in halt()/WFI, which
// is exactly the configuration that tested clean on 2026-08-22. A run in
// that state that still misbehaves indicts the instrument; a clean one
// exonerates it and puts the fault back on core 1. Leave it ON for a normal
// ladder run.
//
// Round 3 (2026-08-23) ran with this OFF and came back **perfectly clean**:
// 2048/2048 frames, zero REU verify errors, ERRCODE 0, a worst-case pass of
// 1716 ARM cycles (1.23us -- never even close to two C64 cycles) across
// 32.14M passes, and a visibly flawless sweep. That exonerates the
// instrument, the widened preload window and multicore bring-up, and leaves
// core 1's *activity* as the only remaining suspect for round 2's
// corruption. It is also the control the ladder now has and did not before.
//
// Back ON since round 4, which answered that question and produced the
// finding the current rung table is built around (see below).
#define GPU64_LADDER_WORKER_ENABLED

// Rungs, in order. Round 17 confirms the answer at the **renderer's real
// shape**, because round 16 answered the milestone's question.
//
// Round 16, all on an L1-resident 16 KB set:
//
//   b5 1M ... b5 32M   burst 5, 1/4/8/16/32 MB/s   L=0/0  x=1542-1544, 2M passes
//   b8  320us          burst 8,  1.6 MB/s          L=0/0  x=1542, 2M passes
//   b12 320us          burst 12, 2.4 MB/s          L=2/0  x=1610, 2M passes
//   b16 320us          burst 16, 3.2 MB/s          L=22/0 x=1757, dead at 471k
//
// **There is no rate ceiling.** 32 MB/s at burst 5 is indistinguishable from
// 1 MB/s at burst 5 -- same worst pass, zero losses -- and RATEK confirmed the
// throttle actually delivered 32000 KB/s. Ten times what a 320x200 50 fps
// framebuffer needs, for free.
//
// **The burst threshold is 8 clean / 12 marginal / 16 fatal**, measured at a
// fixed 320us slot so bursts-per-second was constant and only burst length
// moved.
//
// So milestone 6's rule is: *the render core may write up to 8 consecutive
// cache lines -- 512 bytes -- before yielding, and at that chunk size its
// throughput is unconstrained to at least 32 MB/s.*
//
// Two gaps keep that from being settled, and this round closes them:
//
//   b8 12M / b8 25M -- burst 8 has only been tested at 1.6 MB/s. Everything
//               fast was burst 5. If burst 8 holds at 12.8 and 25.6 MB/s, the
//               rule is a rule and not a coincidence of the two axes.
//   b5 64M   -- one more octave, to establish that "no rate ceiling" is not
//               just "no ceiling below 32".
//   b8 2M lo / b8 2M hi -- the renderer's real shape. Everything since round 13
//               has run on a 16 KB L1-resident set, which generates no bus
//               traffic at all. A 2 MB set at burst 8 misses L2 on every line,
//               at 1.6 MB/s and then at 12.8 MB/s. Rounds 11-13 found footprint
//               irrelevant *at burst 16*, where everything died regardless;
//               this checks it where it matters, at a burst that works.
//   b10 / b12 / b16 -- refines 8-to-12 and re-runs the two known rungs as

// Samples core 0 spends measuring the undisturbed loop before it fixes the
// missed-cycle threshold. ~100ms at rung 0 (park), i.e. the first 5% of rung 0
// is calibration and is not counted in that rung's L=.
//
// The threshold comes off that window's **mean**, not its minimum. Round 3
// (2026-08-23) was a visibly perfect run that the table scored as 31,973,007
// missed cycles out of 32,140,000 passes, because the minimum is not "one C64
// cycle" -- it is the *fastest* pass. The loop is PHI-locked but the lock has
// slop both ways: when the previous pass overran into the next VIC half-cycle,
// this pass's WAIT_FOR_VIC_HALFCYCLE returns immediately and the delta comes
// out short. Round 3 measured min 865 / max 1716 against a nominal 1421, so
// 1.5x the minimum sat *below* the typical healthy pass and tripped on nearly
// all of them.
//
// **Two thresholds, and round 12 is why the first one moved.** `lost2` stays at
// 4/3 of baseline -- 1893, the line that says a pass overran a whole VIC
// half-cycle -- so every number from rounds 10 to 12 stays comparable. `lost`
// is now 9/8, i.e. 1597: not a missed cycle, just a pass measurably longer than
// a healthy one. Round 12's fatal rung scored **L=0/0 with a worst pass of
// 1832** while the C64 went down, because the only counter that existed was the
// coarse one. Clean rungs across rounds 10-12 top out at 1495-1570, so 1597
// sits just above the observed healthy ceiling and turns that 1832 into a
// count instead of a single anecdote in the x= column.
//
// The 4/3 multiplier for `lost2`, rather than 3/2, also cost a round. Passes
// quantise to VIC half-cycles: 1420 healthy, ~2130 for one missed half-cycle,
// ~2840 for a whole missed cycle. A 3/2 threshold is 2130 -- exactly the first
// failure step, which it then fails to exceed. Round 6's first NT rung scored
// `L=0 x=2101`: a missed half-cycle, recorded as clean.
//
// Neither counter sees a stall that happens *mid-pass*, after
// WAIT_FOR_VIC_HALFCYCLE has resynchronised the loop -- that is round 12's
// finding and this file's standing caveat. A rung can corrupt the bus and score
// zero on both.

// Core 0's per-pass bookkeeping -- and **everything core 0 touches on the hot
// path**, deliberately gathered into one 64-byte line that no other core ever
// writes.
//
// This is the fix for round 8, and the bug it fixes had been in the ladder
// since round 1. The state used to be loose globals, and the linker put
// `gpu64LadderThreshold` (read by core 0 on every pass) at 0x690c364 and
// `gpu64LadderRung` (written by core 1 on every millisecond slot) at
// 0x690c370 -- **the same cache line**. So core 1 invalidated core 0's
// hottest line a thousand times a second, in every rung including `idle`,
// where core 1 writes no data at all.
//
// That explains the whole shape of rounds 7 and 8: a dirty idle rung with
// core 1 asleep; 16 KB scoring 128 missed cycles in round 8 after scoring
// zero at 450 MB/s in round 5; the numbers shifting when unrelated code
// changed; and the improvement from 30 to 15 when round 8 padded the stats
// array, which moved these addresses without meaning to. **Rounds 4, 5 and 6
// were clean by link-layout luck, not by design.**
//
// A coherence miss is only ~100 cycles, but the loop is PHI-locked: it must
// finish before the next VIC half-cycle, and when it does not it waits out a
// whole one. So a 100-cycle hiccup quantises into a 710-cycle miss, which is
// exactly the 2130-cycle passes the table has been reporting.
//
// It is also a lesson for milestone 6 proper, not just for the instrument:
// any variable the render core writes that shares a line with something core
// 0 reads per pass will do this, and it will look like a mysterious,
// build-dependent timing fault.
//
// The struct is deliberately a struct rather than the four loop locals it
// started as: as locals they added register pressure to a loop already at the
// limit, and the compiler paid for them by spilling other hot values -- ~500
