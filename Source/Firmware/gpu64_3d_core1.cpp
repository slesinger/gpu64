/*
 gpu64 milestone 6 -- the ring buffer both cores talk through, and core 1's
 drain loop. See gpu64_3d.h and project/milestone6_3d_design.md.

 Through Stage 14, what core 1 did was count: every class 1 opcode ran
 synchronously on core 0, inside the dispatch window where the C64 is already
 DMA-halted, and the ring only kept the cross-core path under real command
 traffic so the timing question milestone 6a opened stayed measurable while
 the pipeline was built.

 Stage 15a (project/gap_filling_plan.md) gave execute() below a real job for
 three opcodes: CLEAR_VIEWPORT, DRAW_MESH and DRAW_NODE run for real on core
 1, via gpu64_3dExecuteRender() (gpu64_3d_class1.cpp, which still owns all
 the session state this needs and cannot export). 15a stalled the whole
 dispatch on the ring fully draining before it returned, for every one of
 the three -- a deliberate zero-concurrency window so there was exactly one
 owner of the framebuffer and the z-buffer at any instant, just relocated
 from "core 0, always" to "core 1, while core 0 waits".

 Stage 15b (same plan doc) narrows that stall to real observation points --
 page flip/vsync commit, a class 0 framebuffer op, a full ring -- instead of
 every dispatch, so a frame of DRAW_NODE calls actually queues and overlaps
 the C64 free-running instead of stalling on each one. This file's own job
 does not change: it still just drains the ring and, for the three render
 ops, calls gpu64_3dExecuteRender(). What changed is on the other side, in
 gpu64_3dDispatch() (gpu64_3d_class1.cpp) -- see the comment above
 drainAndFlush() there for what an observation point is and why every other
 class 1 opcode now drains the ring *before* running, not just after.
