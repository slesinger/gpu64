// gpu64: m_Serial is brought up FIRST, before the framebuffer/anything else that can
// fail, so the earliest possible boot log reaches GPIO14/15 -- this is the
// Tier 1 (bare RPi + UART) debug channel from docs/hw_testing.md. Note that
// gpioInit() below reprograms GPIO14/15 to their cartridge-latch ALT
// functions (OE_Dx/LATCH_A0), so serial output goes dark again after this
// macro returns -- expected, not a bug; it's evidence the code reached that
// point. Once the UART is gone (Tier 2: SD card in the real cartridge) --
// and once DisableIRQs() is called further down in Run(), which also makes
// m_Serial itself go silent -- the only debug channel left is m_HDMIConsole
// (SetPixel-based, immune to both problems). m_Logger is pointed at
// m_TeeLog (bypassing m_Options.GetLogDevice(), which defaults to "tty1"
// i.e. m_Screen's own text console -- unusable here for the same IRQ reason)
// which fans every logger->Write() out to both m_Serial and m_HDMIConsole.
// See tee_device.h.
