// storage core 0 would then have to keep alive, and two entries to a cache
// line.
//
// The ARG copy is what makes the ring safe against the C64 overwriting ARG
// for its next command while core 1 is still working on this one. Blob
// *payloads* are a phase 1 problem and go through the arena; the descriptor
// pointing at them fits here.

// to zero was core 0 not *reading* a line core 1 writes. Core 0 still has to
// know where the tail is to detect a full ring, so it keeps a private cached
// copy (headCache/tailCache below) and only re-reads the real one when that
// copy says full. On a ring that is not full, core 0 never touches core 1's
// line at all.

//
// 32 MB against a C64/REU-side source ceiling of 16 MB, so a program cannot
// fill it from the C64 side in one session even by uploading every byte it
// can address. Static rather than heap: the same reason gpu64_api.cpp stages
// blobs statically -- keeping the memory allocator out of a path core 1
// runs.

// pulling into a staging buffer and core 1 copying it out again, with a
// hand-off protocol to stop core 0 reusing the staging buffer too early. Core
// 0 allocating and pulling straight into the arena removes the copy and the
// protocol together. There is still no lock, and still for the original
