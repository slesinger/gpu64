/*
 gpu64 milestone 6 -- class 1: session state, the resource table, and the
 opcode dispatcher. Through Stage 14 every class 1 opcode, render ops
 included, ran synchronously on core 0. Stage 15a (project/gap_filling_plan.md)
 moves the three render ops -- CLEAR_VIEWPORT, DRAW_MESH, DRAW_NODE -- onto
 core 1, via the ring gpu64_3d_core1.cpp owns; everything else here is
 unchanged and still runs on core 0.

 DRAW_MESH is specified to return when the mesh is drawn and to be illegal
 while the render loop runs -- so there is exactly one owner of the
 framebuffer and the z-buffer at any instant. Stage 15a keeps that true by
 having gpu64_3dDispatch() stall on the ring fully draining before it returns
 for a render op: a zero-concurrency window, just relocated from "core 0,
 always" to "core 1, while core 0 waits" -- see gpu64_3dDispatch() below and
 gpu64-multicore-rule-scoped-to-polling-loop (memory) for why that stall is
 legal from core 0 despite the "never poll MMIO from another core" rule.

 gpu64_3dExecuteRender(), below, is the core-1 half of the three render ops --
 called from gpu64_3d_core1.cpp's execute(), it lives here because it needs
 the session state and resource table this file owns and does not export.
 Every other class 1 opcode is still pushed to the ring purely for its own
 counters (gpu64_3d_core1.cpp's unknownOp), then executed synchronously here
 on core 0, exactly as before Stage 15a.

 Nothing here is portable; the pipeline it drives (gpu64_3d_render.h) is, and
 is exercised on a PC by tools/hostsim.

// --- milestone 18: the level loader -------------------------------------
//
// LOAD_LEVEL/LEVEL_STEP turn the .g64lev file the Pi read off its own SD card
// at start-up (gpu64_level.cpp) into textures, meshes and object nodes. It
// lives here rather than in gpu64_level.cpp because this is the file that
// owns the resource table, the arena allocator and the scene -- the parser
// deliberately knows about none of them.
//
// Why it is sliced. Building E1M1 is 66 textures, 108 meshes and 108 nodes;
// done in one command the C64 would be DMA-halted for the whole of it, and if
// anything in the middle failed the only reading would be one ERRCODE with no
// way to say which of 282 items produced it. One bounded slice per command
// gives both a loading bar and a per-item failure address, and keeps each
// hold in the same range as the 64 KB REU transfers this cartridge already
// does routinely.
//
// Why no SD access here. reuUsingPolling() is running: an EMMC transfer's
// MMIO traffic would wreck core 0's per-C64-cycle bus timing the same way a
// second core spinning on a register does (CLAUDE.md, "Multicore"). The file
// is therefore already in RAM before the polling loop ever starts, and this
// code only ever reads memory.
//
// Why not on core 1. The arena allocator is core-0-owned and unlocked, so a
// core-1 build would race any concurrent UPLOAD_MESH; and a startup-time
// build would not survive anyway, since gpu64_3dReset() wipes s_Res, the
// arena, s_State and s_Scene at every session reset. The load has to be
// C64-triggerable, and it has to be here.

// Bytes of source blob a single LEVEL_STEP will consume before it returns.
// 16 KB is roughly one 128x128 texture with its mip chain, or a dozen meshes;
// at E1M1's 620 KB that is about 40 commands for the whole level.
