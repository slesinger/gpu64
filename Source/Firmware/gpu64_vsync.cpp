// as the two cases this guards against, but originally gave the first no
// second chance). Found 2026-08-30: a hardware run had every SCENE_COMMIT
// fail UNSUPPORTED for the whole session because this boot-time call failed
// once and nothing ever retried it -- Stage 16's SCENE_COMMIT is the first
// caller to hard-require gpu64Vsync.calibrated with no immediate-flip
// fallback the way PAGE_FLIP(ARG0=0) has, so this is the first opcode to
// make a cold calibration failure fatal to a whole feature instead of just
// leaving one optional command UNSUPPORTED. Cost of retrying: each failed
// attempt is one failed mailbox call (cheap) rather than a full timed pass,
// except the attempt that actually gets going, which costs the usual ~0.5s.
