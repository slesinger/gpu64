/*
 gpu64: the 80x50 text mode -- class 0 opcodes $50-$5F.

 A second display *mode*, not a layer over the graphics one: entering it
 re-programs the VideoCore for a 640x400 surface (768x544 with the border)
 and leaving it puts the 320x200 paged display back. See
 CGpu64FrameBuffer::SetMode() for why that is a whole framebuffer switch and
 not a viewport change.

 The model is deliberately the C64's own, so a 6502 programmer already knows
 it: three parallel 4000-byte planes -- screen codes, foreground colour,
 background colour -- indexed row-major, and glyphs that are the machine's
 own character ROM (gpu64_c64font.h). Screen code bit 7 is reverse video,
 exactly as it is on a C64 screen. What the C64 does not have, and this does,
 is a per-cell *background* colour and 256 colours in both planes.

 Rendering is immediate and per cell: text mode has one page and a fixed
 scanout address, so a cell is repainted where it stands and there is no
 flip. That is why none of the paging machinery applies here, and why the
 API refuses PAGE_FLIP and the class 1/2 render paths while this mode is up.
