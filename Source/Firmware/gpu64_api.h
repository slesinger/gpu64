/*
 gpu64: the IO2 command API register file and dispatcher.

 Wire protocol reference (register map, opcode table, error codes):
 docs/api_design.md. Design rationale: project/milestone4_2d_api_design.md.

 Everything here runs synchronously on core 0, called straight from
 reuUsingPolling()'s IO2 write handler in rad_reu.cpp -- the same
 immediate-mode model milestone 2's test pattern and milestone 3's mirror
 already use. Nothing here allocates, blocks, or loops unboundedly: the one
 cost that scales is a blob transfer, and it scales with a length the C64
 itself chose.

// gpu64 2026-09-27: the block lives at $DF50-$DF68 (it was $DF0B-$DF23).
// The old window overlapped the Ultimate's Command Interface at $DF1B-$DF1F
// (project/uci_register_remap_design.md), and the next free byte, $DF20, is
// where the Ultimate maps Ultimate Audio. $DF50 is chosen for the address
// multiplexer, not for tidiness: a half-switched '257 can only ADD one-bits
// to the high nibble (the signal nibble it switches away from is $C-$F), so
// the valid nibbles must not be supersets of one another. REU's $0 plus our
// $5 and $6 satisfy that; $2 and $3 would not. See GPU64_MUX_BAD_NIBBLES.
//
// $DF0B-$DF4F is deliberately not ours and not REU's: the polling loop
// neither drives a read nor acts on a write there (rad_reu.cpp), so the
// UCI and anything else in that range owns the bus alone.

// --- the one-shot key for destructive opcodes ---------------------------
//
// gpu64 (2026-09-10, bench run 14). The bus loses and mis-samples writes
// (CLAUDE.md, "The bus is not reliable"), and two bench runs have now caught
// an opcode EXECUTING that the C64 never sent: run 11 a LOOP_STOP, run 14
// something that wiped the live scene's active camera. A command that only
// draws survives that -- one frame is wrong and the next is right. A command
// that destroys state does not: the session is over and nothing says why.
//
// So every destructive opcode demands this byte in ARG15, and
// gpu64_apiDispatch() SPENDS ARG15 on every dispatch of every class. The key
// is therefore valid for exactly one command, the one that staged it:
// a phantom CMD_LO write arriving at any other moment finds ARG15 zero and
// is refused with BAD_ARGS, counted in gpu64ApiDiag.keyRefused along with
// its opcode. The residue it cannot cover is a real keyed command whose own
// opcode byte is mis-sampled into a different destructive opcode, which is
// one write instead of a whole stream.
//
// $A5 rather than a small number: 10100101 shares no bit pattern with a
// plausible coordinate or id byte, and an ARG register left over from a
// previous command is overwhelmingly likely to hold one of those.
#define GPU64_KEY_DESTRUCTIVE	0xA5
#define GPU64_REG_KEY		( GPU64_ARG_COUNT - 1 )	// ARG15, i.e. $DF65

// --- the checked-command key --------------------------------------------
//
// gpu64 (2026-09-25, bench run 41). Writing every argument byte twice
// (the game's stage2) defeats a write the polling loop does not sample, but
// not one it samples with a bit flipped: the second pass is simply believed,
// and a retained scene keeps believing it. Run 41 still flickered E1M1's
// far side through the walls, and runsim --bus-fault=data showed every event
// was one of those -- a camera 4, 8 or 128 units off for one frame, a door
// displaced until the refresh ring got to it.
//
// So a command may carry its own check. ARG15 = GPU64_KEY_CHECKED | n says
// ARG14 holds the XOR of that ARG15 byte, CMD_HI, CMD_LO, ID_LO, ID_HI and
// ARG0..ARG(n-1). The length travels in the key because ARGs the command
// does not write still hold the previous command's bytes, which the C64
// cannot vouch for. A mismatch is refused with BAD_ARGS before any class
// sees the command -- nothing executes -- and an absolute command can simply
// be sent again. CMD_LO is in the sum, so a CMD_LO flipped into another
// opcode is refused too.
//
// It rides the same one-shot ARG15 as the destructive key and is spent with
// it, so it is optional and costs nothing when absent: a firmware that
// predates it sees neither $A5 nor anything else it knows, and runs the
// command unchecked. What it cannot cover is the key byte itself being lost
// or flipped out of the $D0 range -- the command then runs unchecked, which
// is where every command was before.
#define GPU64_KEY_CHECKED	0xD0	// high nibble; low nibble = n, 0..14
#define GPU64_REG_CHECK		( GPU64_ARG_COUNT - 2 )	// ARG14, i.e. $DF64

// --- strict mode --------------------------------------------------------
//
// gpu64 (2026-09-27, bench video). The check covers a command the C64 sent
// with a byte damaged. It cannot cover a command the C64 never sent: a
// phantom CMD_LO write finds ARG15 already spent to zero, runs unchecked,
// and executes on whatever the last real command staged. E1M1 showed it --
// SET_PERSPECTIVE run on SET_POSITION's coordinates, a 145-degree field of
// view until the refresh ring re-sent the real one.
//
// So the first checked SCENE_COMMIT switches strict mode on: from then on a
// class 1 command must carry either a check that matches or the destructive
// key, or it is refused with BAD_ARGS (gpu64ApiDiag.strictRefused). The
// exceptions are the commands that change no retained state -- a phantom of
// one of those costs nothing, and making every query carry a check is not
// worth it. A keyed SCENE_RESET, gpu64_apiFullReset() (FULL_RESET, a C64
// reset) and gpu64_apiReset() switch it off again, so a program that
// never checks is never affected.
